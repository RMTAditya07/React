1.React transition group
    - Transition
        =   entering
        =   entered
        =   exiting
        =   exited

    -CSS transition
        =   appear
        =   enter
        =   exit
    -transition group

2.Forms use controlled components

    In React, whatever the value user types we save it in state and pass the same value to the input tag as its value, so here its value is not changed by DOM, it is controlled by react state
